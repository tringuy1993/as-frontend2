        I began my frontend and fullstack development with my curiosity of how{" "}
        <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/derivatives/option-greeks/">
          greek options
        </a>{" "}
        work in the financial world. I started out with a complex repository I
        found online that can fetch data from an API endpoint and display the
        data via <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">Dash Plotly</a>. Dash plotly
        is a great library for beginner like me because there are many tutorials
        out there on youtube, more specifically{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CharmingData"> Charming Data</a>.
        Charming Data is an amazing source that taught me to plot data and most
        importantly got me to where I am today, deploy a webpage - then
        fullstack. I learned a great deal from Charming Data. However, I
        realized I need to pursue fullstack development in-depth in order to
        organize my code structure and layout in cohesive manner that I can
        potentially scale to larger audience down the road. Additionally, I
        thought it is more beneficial to understand the fundamentals of how and
        why my code work rather than following tutorial blindly.
